## Scala Application

### Installing Scala

This requires that you have scala installed and able to run scala via the commandline.

Directions for installing scala can be found at [http://scala-lang.org/download/install.html](http://scala-lang.org/download/install.html).

### Running the application

Here are the steps to run the scala script:

	$ scala countnumbers.scala < input.txt

or if you are on *nix or mac:

	$ ./countnumbers.scala < input.txt


### Example of output

	$ scala countnumbers.scala < input.txt

## iOS Application

I have also included an iOS application that can be built and pushed to an emulator or device.
This requires an Intel MacOX X machine with Xcode to build the application.
